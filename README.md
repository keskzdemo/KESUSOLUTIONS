  Easily add or remove product items within an order in real-time with immediate updates to the interface.

  The system intelligently pre-fills and locks down key fields such as *game name* and *order type* based on predefined keywords from the package input.

* **Contextual User Input Fields**
  Customer-related input fields (e.g., UID, ID/Password) are shown only when necessary, based on the type of products added — keeping the interface clean and relevant.

* **Dual-format Summary Generation**
  Automatically generates two distinct summary formats:
  • **Customer Summary** – suitable for payment confirmation.
  • **Internal Summary** – includes all essential information for fulfillment.

* **One-click Copy to Clipboard**
  Each summary can be copied with a single click, enabling quick transfer of order details to other platforms or messaging apps.
